## Overview

The Mind Sealer helps you retain knowledge more effectively by automatically identifying the most relevant passages for your learning goals, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and innovative selection strategies.

## Features

- ðŸ“š Automated text passage selection
- ðŸŽ¯ Custom relevance filtering based on your learning objectives
- ðŸ“‘ PDF and text document support
- ðŸ¤– Multiple LLM strategies for content analysis
- âš¡ Optimized for incremental learning workflows


## Inspiration

The project's name draws inspiration from Liu Cixin's acclaimed science fiction novel "The Three-Body Problem," which features a fascinating concept called the "Mind Seal" â€” a technique that permanently imprints information into one's consciousness. While we can't quite achieve that level of retention, we can get closer through smart learning techniques.

## Why Mind Sealer?

Traditional reading often leads to information overload, with critical insights lost among less relevant details. Even when using Incremental Readingâ€”a powerful technique that breaks down learning materials into manageable chunks for spaced reviewâ€”the challenge remains: how do you identify which passages are truly worth your time?

Mind Sealer solves this by automatically analyzing your learning materials and selecting the most relevant content for your specific needs.
